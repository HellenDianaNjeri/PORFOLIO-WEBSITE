        <H2>My amazing work</H2>
        <p>Here are some of the projects I have worked on:</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/HellenDianaNjeri/SE-DAY-1-ASSIGNMENT.git">python calcultor</a> <br> I created a Python-based calculator that performs basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with advanced features like exponentiation. I used core programming concepts such as functions, conditionals, and loops to ensure accurate user input handling and clear results. This project helped strengthen my Python skills and problem-solving abilities.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/PLP-WebTechnologies/feb-2025-introduction-to-css-HellenDianaNjeri.git">Tech Goals</a> <br> In this project, I developed a foundational understanding of CSS by creating and styling responsive web pages. I applied core concepts like selectors, the box model, Flexbox, and Grid to structure layouts effectively, ensuring clean and maintainable code. Through version control with Git and GitHub, I managed project iterations, documented progress, and refined my workflow. This experience strengthened my front-end development skills, attention to detail in design, and ability to troubleshoot styling challenges. It also reinforced the importance of organized, semantic HTML paired with efficient CSSâ€”key principles I now carry into every web project.</p>
